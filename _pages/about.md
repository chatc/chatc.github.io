Hi~ I am Yusen Zhang, a first-year CS PhD student at Penn State University, advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). I received my master's degree from Emory University, advised by Dr. [Jinho D. Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. When I was in Beijing, I interned at Big Data Mining Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) where I started my research on NLP.


Research
======
My research interests lie in applying Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, focusing on Natural Language Generation. Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Interactive, high-fidelity Semantic Parsing.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Long document and dialogue text summarization.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Language Generation Evaluation.**  


I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
