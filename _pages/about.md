Hi~ I am Yusen Zhang, a fourth-year CS PhD student at Penn State University, advised by Dr. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/). I have done industry research internships at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. I also worked closely with Dr. [Dragomir Radev](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). I received my master's degree from Emory University, advised by Dr. [Jinho D. Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. When I was in Beijing, I interned at Big Data Mining Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/) where I started my research on NLP.


Research
======
My research interests lie in applying Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, focusing on Natural Language Generation. Specifically, I am interested in the following research topics:  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Scalable, efficient, trustworthy, Multi-Agent Large Language Model systems.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Human-centric Large Language Model evaluation and applications.**  


<u>I am applying for postdoctoral positions starting in Fall 2025 to advance my research on multi-agent LLM systems. I am actively seeking opportunities in this area and welcome any related information or openings. I am also open to academic collaborations—please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together!</u>
