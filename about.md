I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology in June, 2018. Before I got my BS, I was a full-time research intern at Big Data Mining Group, Microsoft Research Asia. And I was the leader of the ACM training team of Beijing Institute of Technology and the president of association for art of algorithm and programming.

My research interests lie within deep learning for Natural Language Processing, particularly in Named Entity Recognition. I am also involved in Machine Learning theory like optimization algorithms.
